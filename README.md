# Assignment 2 (design)
Mico Santiago

## Based on what we know about linked lists, stacks, and queues, design a queue data structure

### 1.	 What functions are we likely to need for a queue to function like the one discussed in class?	
The queue we talked in class was LIFO or last in first out, like in a queue of cars at a toll, a care enter from the back and the first car in front leaves, therefore insertion performed at one end and deletion can be performed at the other. Functions would include
	-	A operation that means to insert an item into the back of the queue. (Push)
	-	A operation that removes the front item. (Pop)
	-	A operation that tells us the whats in the front.
	-	A operation that tells us it is empty.
